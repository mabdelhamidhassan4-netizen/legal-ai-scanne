Project Legal AI Scanner 

 Brief project idea 

An intelligent agent for examining and analyzing contracts and legal documents with the aim of detecting indicators of forgery or tampering using artificial intelligence techniques (OCR + NLP).
The front-end of the application is built on the Lovable platform, while the back-end processing is done on AWS services (S3 - Textract - Comprehend) using code written and generated by Amazon Q Developer.
 The problem that the project addresses:
Forgery of contracts and documents causes significant financial and legal losses, and the manual inspection process takes a long time and requires a lot of experience.
The intelligent agent helps speed up initial document screening, providing initial clues and analysis that help:
Lawyers
Judicial authorities
Financial institutions
Insurance companies
Real estate offices
Universities
Private companies
It enables a quick initial decision on a document, which reduces the spread of forgery and is also used before signing contracts or during business dealings.
The application can be used in:
Financial contracts
Bank transactions
Purchase and sale contracts between individuals
Ownership and real estate documents
Insurance company documents
University papers and certificates
Issues of division of inheritance
Any official or commercial documents need a quick scan
In short: Any legal or commercial transaction depends on the authenticity of documents.

Proposed technical solution:
A simple and user-friendly application based on an intelligent agent that scans contracts and documents using artificial intelligence techniques.
A two-interface MVP prototype has now been implemented via the Lovable platform
1- Data entry screen
Name
Email
Document type
Upload file
Then
“Scan” button

2- The results display screen will display the user name, email, examination date, and document. This is very briefly on the second screen 
Then
Document summary
Extracted text
Suspicious indicators
Initial evaluation of the document

 Back-end processing components
 As follows:
Python code created with the help of Amazon Q Developer was used, and performs the following tasks:
1. Upload the file to Amazon S3
2. Use Amazon Textract to extract text from a document (OCR)
3. Use Amazon Comprehend to analyze text and extract entities and patterns

4. Produce a final report in JSON format
It is sent to appear in the results screen within the app

Project impact:
Significantly reduce the time required to manually scan documents
Supporting lawyers and judicial authorities in quickly sorting questionable documents
Reduce the possibility of documents being forged before they are used
Use it as a primary screening layer in large institutions 
Very strong business opportunities
Subscriptions for lawyers and legal offices
Monthly or annual subscription for banks
Subscription for government and private institutions
Packages for real estate companies
Packages for insurance companies
Subscriptions to universities and educational institutions

Important note:
The code is written and generated entirely using Amazon Q Developer.
The MVP has already been built, but there is no real connection with Amazon Textract or Amazon Comprehend because the current version is just a prototype (MVP) for demonstration only.
The services will be activated immediately when moving to the final version
